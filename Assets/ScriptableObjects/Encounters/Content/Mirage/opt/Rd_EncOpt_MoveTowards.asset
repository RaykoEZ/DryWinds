      - Yet the skylines never seem to change in size.
      - Just as you reverse your course...
      - A harsh breeze uncovers something underground...
      - An abandoned shelter.
      - Though the entrance is blocked by a complex mechanism, you are able to obtain
        tools left by the previous visitors.
