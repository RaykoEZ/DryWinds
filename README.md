# Project Dry Winds

This is a Unity project for a 2D turn-based tactical game with cards and grid-based movement.

The player character needs to reach specific locations on the map while enemies and encounters await them. 

The player can play cards to engage in combat or recon at the cost of time. As time passes, events on the map will trigger and increase the difficulty/add special conditions to the level.
